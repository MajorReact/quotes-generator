This code is a JavaScript program that retrieves data from an external API containing a collection of quotes, and displays a random quote with the author's name on an HTML page. The program also updates the background color of the page and the color of two buttons whenever a new quote is displayed.

It uses jQuery library to retrieve data from the API and dynamically update the HTML and CSS of the page. It uses AJAX to make a request to the API and retrieve the data in JSON format, and then parses the JSON data to extract the quotes.

Then uses a function to select a random quote from the collection and updates the text of the quote and the author's name on the page. It also updates the href attribute of two buttons to include the current quote and author, so users can share the quote on Twitter or Tumblr.

jQuery is used to animate the fading in and out of the current quote and author text, as well as the background color and button color changes. The program also adds an event listener to a button to enable users to generate a new random quote.
